//: ## Q1: Optionals
//: The compiler is yelling at us. Why isn't this the correct way to unwrap optionals?

class Foo {
    
    var wordA : String!
    var wordB : String!
    
    init (words: [String?]) {
        wordA = words[0]!
        wordB = words[1]!
    }
    
//: [EXPLAIN YOUR ANSWER TO Q1 HERE]
//Q1:optional has no effect. expression inside init function already produces "String"?
    
    
//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
//: Why does the compiler dislike the for loop? Also, what should we return?
                                    // cant put ! here as we cant make sure the user wont put null in here. 
    class func arePalindromes(words: [String]) -> Bool! {
        let reversedWords = words.map() {String($0.characters.reverse())}

                return false
            }
        }
        return true
    }
    
//: [EXPLAIN YOUR ANSWER TO Q2 HERE]
//Q2: Because let is used to create constant. But in this case we need to keep updating i. So we cant pass immutable value to mutating operator.
    
    
//: ## Q3: More functions, and object initialization
//: The method should be returning true or false -- what's wrong?
//: Are we initializing the dictionary correctly?
    class func isAnagram(wordA: String, wordB: String) -> Bool! {

//: [EXPLAIN YOUR ANSWER TO Q3 HERE]
// the initialization of dictionary should be in the form of [character, int]()
// and we need to add an exclamation mark for the return type as the return value has to be either True or False.

//: **Do not** change anything below.
//: You should be able to call the methods as is.

//???why do we need wordB here?
